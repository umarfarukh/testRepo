                                Hi, Cognizant believes in a focused and continuous learning process that helps you
                                seamlessly adapt from academic life to the professional world. This begins with
                                a classroom-based Campus Associate Training Program (CATP) for the first 14 weeks,
                                followed by an on-the-job Dovetail training program for the subsequent 8 months.
                                These programs are aimed at helping you become a well-rounded IT professional in
                                the first year itself.
                            </p>

                                The Campus Associate Training program includes modules that cover technology, process
                                and behavioral skills. As part of the program, tests and quiz sessions are conducted
                                during and at the end of every module. Your performance in these tests and quizzes
                                determines your success in the CATP.
