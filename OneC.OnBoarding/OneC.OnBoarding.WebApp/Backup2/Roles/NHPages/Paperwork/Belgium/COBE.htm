                            Our success in the marketplace requires the trust and confidence of the investment
                            community. Achieving this trust requires that we act with integrity when trading
                            public securities, following federal and state securities laws. When we succumb
                            to temptation and trade on “inside” information, stock prices can be affected, often
                            with a negative impact on shareholders.
