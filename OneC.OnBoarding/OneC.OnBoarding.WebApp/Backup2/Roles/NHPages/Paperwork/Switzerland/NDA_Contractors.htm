                                made wholly or partially by the Company or the Consultant at any time during the

                                civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential
                                Information, it is agreed that the Consultant or the Company or their representatives,
                                as the case may be, will provide Cognizant with prompt notice of such request(s)
                                so that Cognizant may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate
                                remedy and/or waive compliance with the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.
                                If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Cognizant grants a
                                waiver hereunder, the Company or the Consultant or their representatives may furnish

                                any Confidential Information so furnished. Save in respect of disclosure to any
                                Court or other authority where compelled to do so, the fact of such compulsion does
                                not relieve either the Consultant or the Company of their obligations regarding
                                Confidential Information as set out in paragraph 8. </li>
                            <li><u>Return of Confidential Information and other property</u>. Promptly following the earlier
                                of (i) the termination of this Agreement and (ii) the written request of Cognizant,
                                the Company or the Consultant will deliver to Cognizant all documents or other materials
                                furnished by Cognizant to the Company or the Consultant together with all copies

                                together with all copies thereof in the possession of the Company or the Consultant,
                                will be destroyed or irretrievably deleted with any such destruction or deletion
                                confirmed by the Consultant or the Company in writing to Cognizant. </li>

                                Consultant are not the legal representatives or agents of, nor do they have the
                                power to bind Cognizant or any of its Affiliates for any purpose whatsoever. The
                                scope of the Company’s and the Consultant’s engagement does not include any supervisory
                                responsibilities with respect to Cognizant personnel or that of any of its Affiliates.
                                The Company and the Consultant expressly acknowledge that the relationship intended
                                to be created by this Agreement is a business relationship based entirely on and
                                circumscribed by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Agency Agreement
                                and that no partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship
                                is intended or created by reason of this Agreement. Cognizant shall carry no worker's
                                compensation insurance or any health or accident insurance to cover the Consultant.
                                Cognizant shall not pay contributions to social security, national insurance fund,
                                or national, federal or state withholding taxes, nor provide any other contributions
                                or benefits which might be expected in an employer-employee relationship. </li>
