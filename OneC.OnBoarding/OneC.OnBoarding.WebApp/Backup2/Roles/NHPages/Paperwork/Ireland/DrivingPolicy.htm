                           Cognizant considers health and safety at work to be of paramount importance. We also have a statutory duty 
                           under the Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974 to ensure the safety of anyone who drives on Cognizant’ 
                           business and of anyone else who may be affected by our associates’ actions when driving in the course of 
                           their duties. This policy sets out what is required from those who drive during the course of carrying out 
                           their role at Cognizant and to ensure the levels of associated risk are properly managed and controlled. 
                           The guidance given in this policy does not replace an individual’s own duty to comply with any legal 
                           requirements that they may be subject to when driving.

                          Instead, before setting off on a journey, phones and emails should be diverted to voicemail where an up to

                          Drivers should never feel that the nature of their job makes it difficult to abide by drink/driving legislation. A conviction for drink-driving, whether or not incurred while on Cognizant Business is viewed by Cognizant as serious and may have an impact on the commercial terms Cognizant agrees with its clients as well as a Driver’s ability to carry out his or her role.

                         It is an offence to drive if unfit through the use of drugs and the law makes no distinction between impairment due to illicit drugs or those which have been lawfully prescribed or purchased. If prescribed or non prescribed drugs are purchased, check whether they will affect the ability to drive. If a Driver’s ability to drive safely could be or is affected by drugs or any form of treatment, or the Driver has been convicted of an offence relating driving while taking drugs or medication the Driver should notify talent management immediately, and driving on Cognizant Business is prohibited unless and until Cognizant confirms that driving on Cognizant Business may be resumed.

                          Drivers should not smoke whilst driving on Cognizant Business due to the potential distraction. Although the laws against smoking in the workplace do not apply to private vehicles when used for business, we ask all Drivers not to smoke while driving, and we expect anybody occupying a car on or in relation to Cognizant Business (whether driving or not) to have consideration in this respect for any non-smokers who may also be in the vehicle and to respect any request made by the owner of a vehicle not to smoke in it. Where a Driver is using a hired car on Cognizant Business, in addition to the terms of this policy, he or she is required to comply with any additional requirements that the rental company may have in relation to smoking in its vehicles.
