I understand that as a newly-eligible associate, I will only have 31 days from my date of hire in order to elect coverage during this coverage year. I understand that if I do <u style="font-weight:bold">not</u>  elect coverage during this time, I <u style="font-weight:bold">will not </u> be able to elect coverage until the next annual Open Enrollment period unless I experience a “Qualifying Life Event” as described below. I acknowledge that by failing to elect coverage, I will bear all financial risk associated with medical, dental, and vision care expenses. Cognizant has provided me with an opportunity to make an election of coverage and I understand how to elect coverage if I so desire.
