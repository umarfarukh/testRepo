                                Services, LLC (“Cognizant”)
                            </p>

                                1. As stated during the Cognizant Town Hall Meeting on Friday June 15, 2012, we
                                are amending your offer of employment letter with Cognizant, dated June 15, 2012
                                (the “Offer Letter”) with respect to your paid time off. The following shall amend
                                and replace in its entirety the “Vacation” paragraph in your Offer Letter.
                            </p>

                                   <b style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;"> PAID TIME OFF:</b> You will remain on a modified version of the ING U.S. Paid Time Off
                                    (“PTO”) policy with effect from your hire date with Cognizant. However, your annual
                                    Paid Time Off allotment will be fixed and will not grow in the future based on your
                                    tenure. Your annual PTO allotment with Cognizant will be calculated using your tenure
                                    as of the end of the year 2013, with effect from your date of hire with Cognizant.
                                    This allotment may be equal to or greater than your current annual PTO allotment
                                    depending on your service date with ING U.S. You will not receive any adjustment
                                    to your base salary as a result of this arrangement. Your PTO allotment will include
                                    vacation, sick time and personal days
                                    <br />

                                    <li>If you are an employee based in North Dakota, you will begin to accrue PTO with
                                        Cognizant with effect from October 1, 2012. If you are an employee based in any
                                        other state, you will begin to accrue PTO with Cognizant with effect from September
                                        1, 2012.</li>
                                    <br />
                                    <li>Full-time and part-time regular employees are eligible for PTO. Part-time employees
                                        receive a prorated PTO allotment based on their scheduled hours.</li>
                                    <br />
                                    <li>Except for employees in North Dakota, your PTO allotment is provided monthly at
                                        1/12 of your annual allotment. PTO may be used prior to earning it as long as use
                                        does not exceed the maximum for the year. For employees in North Dakota, your PTO
                                        allotment is provided incrementally throughout the year on a quarterly basis. You
                                        will receive 25% of your allotment on the first day of each new quarter. PTO is
                                        not available for use until it is allotted to you.</li>
                                    <br />
                                    <li>If you increase or decrease your scheduled hours, your PTO allotment for the year
                                        will be adjusted at that time. Short-term changes for less than three months or
                                        changes in the fourth quarter do not require an adjustment to your PTO allotment.
                                        Full-time employees may carry over a maximum of 40 hours into the next calendar
                                        year. The maximum carryover for part-time employees shall be prorated based on the
                                        number of hours you work in a workweek. Carryover PTO hours must be used before
                                        you tap into your new allotment of PTO.</li>
