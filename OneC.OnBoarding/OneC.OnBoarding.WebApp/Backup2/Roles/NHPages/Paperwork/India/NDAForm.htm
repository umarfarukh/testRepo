                                forbids employees from disclosing material non-public information about our Company.
                                Disclosure of such information is a crime under U.S. securities law and may result
                                in immediate termination of employment. Information concerning Cognizant shall be
                                considered "inside" or "nonpublic" if it has not previously been made generally
                                available to the public. Inside information shall be "material" if it relates to
                                Cognizant's financial condition or prospects and its dissemination is likely to
                                affect the market price of our stock or if there is a substantial likelihood that
