                                In consideration of Cognizant Technology Solutions Canada, Inc. (“COGNIZANT”) furnishing
                                to me an American Express Corporate Card (the “AMEX Card”) and intending to be legally
                                bound, I, the undersigned Corporate Cardmember, acknowledge and agree as follows:
                            </p>
                            <br />

                                <li>I shall use the AMEX Card for all COGNIZANT business travel expenses and agree that
                                    the AMEX Card must be used to pay for airline tickets and car rental in order for
                                    me to be reimbursed by COGNIZANT. I understand and agree that the AMEX Card shall
                                    be used only for business travel expenses and shall not be used for personal expenses.</li>
                                <li>I agree to report actual business expenses at least monthly (unless travel is less
                                    frequent) and to obtain prior management approval for expense items not covered
                                    by COGNIZANT’s Travel Expense Policy. In the event that my employment ends for any
                                    reason, I agree to report actual business expenses and to reimburse COGNIZANT for
                                    any other expenses on or before my last day of work.</li>
                                <li>I am fully liable for all charges on my AMEX Card and must submit timely expense
                                    reports to ensure full payment of all charges (minus disputed charges properly reported)
                                    by the due date indicated on each statement.</li>
                                <li>I will not be reimbursed by COGNIZANT for delinquency or finance charges.</li>
                                <li>I understand and agree that AMEX Card accounts 90 days or more past due will be
                                    reviewed by COGNIZANT Management.</li>
                                <li>I understand and agree that COGNIZANT may pay American Express the balance due on
                                    delinquent accounts at 110 days past due.
                                    <ol style="margin-left: 24px; list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                                        <li>If I am still employed by COGNIZANT at that time, I understand that COGNIZANT will
                                            give me, the delinquent Corporate Cardmember, the option of either (1) payroll deduction
                                            under the terms of a promissory note for the balance due or (2) immediate direct
                                            payment to or reimbursement of COGNIZANT by me;</li>
                                        <li>If my employment with COGNIZANT has terminated for any reason and there is a balance
                                            due on my AMEX Card account which is a personal expense or which is not supported
                                            by an expense report in compliance with COGNIZANT’S TRAVEL EXPENSE POLICY, I understand
                                            and agree that COGNIZANT may deduct the balance due on my account from any compensation
                                            due me from COGNIZANT including, but not limited to, wages, salary, accrued and
                                            unpaid vacation benefits, severance and/or bonus payments of any kind; and</li>
                                        <li>If the compensation described in (b) above is insufficient to reimburse COGNIZANT
                                            for the delinquent balance due, I understand that COGNIZANT may recover such delinquent
                                            balance by lawsuit or by such other means or combination of means as COGNIZANT deems
                                            necessary.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>If I submit expenses that are not in compliance with COGNIZANT’s Travel Expense
                                    Policy, I risk delayed, partial, or forfeited reimbursement. I agree that significant
                                    abuse of the AMEX Card may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</li>
                                <li>At such time as I cease employment with COGNIZANT, I must provide proof of expense
                                    report submission and reconciliation of all outstanding AMEX Card charges. I understand
                                    that my failure to do so may result in COGNIZANT deduction of the outstanding balance
                                    or taking such other action as described in subparagraphs 6(b) and (c) above.</li>
                                <li>I understand and agree that I am permitted to use the AMEX Card only for business
                                    expenses and that use of the AMEX Card for personal charges is strictly prohibited.</li>
