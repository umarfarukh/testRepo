                            This memorandum sets forth the policy of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation

                            Disclosure (the “Insider Trading Policy”) is designed to prevent insider trading
                            or the appearance of impropriety, to satisfy the Company’s obligation to reasonably
                            supervise the activities of Company personnel, and to help Company personnel avoid
                            the severe consequences associated with violations of insider trading laws. <b>It is
                                your obligation to understand and comply with this Insider Trading Policy</b>.

                            establish trading windows outside of which the persons covered by the Trading Procedures
                            will be restricted from trading in the Company’s securities and also require the

                            before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider how enforcement

                            The announcement of the Company’s quarterly financial results almost always has
                            the potential to have a material effect on the market for the Company’s securities.
                            Although you may not know the financial results prior to public announcement, if
                            you engage in a trade before the financial results are disclosed to the public,
                            such trades may give an appearance of impropriety that could subject you and the
                            Company to a charge of insider trading. Therefore, subject to limited exceptions,
                            you may trade in Company securities only during four quarterly trading windows.
                            Unless otherwise advised, the four trading windows consist of the periods that begin
                            after market close on the second full trading day following the Company’s issuance
                            of a press release (or other method of broad public dissemination) announcing its

                            evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline
                            in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no confidence in
                            the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the
                            seller’s incentive to improve the Company’s performance. For these reasons, short
                            sales of the Company’s securities are prohibited by the Company. In addition, Section
                            16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, prohibits officers and

                            means that are reasonably designed to provide broad public access. Before a person

                            While the Company encourages its stockholders and potential investors to obtain
                            as much information as possible about the Company, the Company believes that information
                            should come from its publicly-filed SEC reports, press releases and external website
                            or from a designated Company spokesperson, rather than from speculation or unauthorized

                            is designed to ensure that the information the Company discloses is accurate and

                            reviewed by management and legal counsel before they are made public. Any communications

                            In addition, with the advent of the Internet, and the emergence of electronic bulletin

                            prospects have become common. Inappropriate communications disseminated on the Internet
                            may pose an inherently greater risk due to the size of the audience they can reach.
                            These forums have the potential to move a stock price significantly, and very rapidly

                            often is unreliable, and in some cases, may be deliberately false. The SEC has investigated
                            and prosecuted a number of fraudulent schemes involving electronic bulletin boards
                            and chat rooms. You may encounter information about the Company on the Internet

                            Both the SEC and the national securities exchanges, through the Financial Industry
                            Regulatory Authority (FINRA), investigate and are very effective at detecting insider
                            trading. The SEC, together with federal prosecutors, pursue insider trading violations
                            vigorously. For instance, cases have been successfully prosecuted against trading
                            by employees in foreign accounts, trading by family members and friends, and trading
                            involving only a small number of shares.</p>
